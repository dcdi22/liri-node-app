# liri-node-app

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

Please use one of the following commands:
`my-tweets` if you want your 20 most recent tweets
`spotify-this-song` enter a track title to get more info about the song and it's artist
`movie-this` enter a movie title and get a shmorgishborg of info you didn't know you didn't really need
`do-what-it-says` will do what ever you say in the random.txt
